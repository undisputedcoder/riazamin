										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>G'day there, my name is Riaz Amin and I'm currently a third year student at Murdoch University studying Computer Science and Mobile and Web Application devlopment. During the course of my studies I've developed a keen interest in artificial intelligence after studying a unit about intelligent agents. More specifically, my interests are in both machine learning and deep learning. I've also learned that web development isn't my thing and so I've ruled out on being a web developer. However, I enjoyed learning how to develop mobile applications in Flutter using Dart and is something I would definitely consider doing as a career. In the end, my goal is to become a software developer (preferrably in Java) and work on meaningful projects with a team with other developers that think differently to drive innovation.</p>

									<h2>Personality</h2>
									<p>I was a quiet and shy boy and had an introverted personality. As a result, I was just a kid that was more of a follower than a leader and didn't like to talk in front of an audience. I did make as a great teammate and always helped others or the team. It is in my nature to not be selfish and always do whats best for the team or make the people around me better. Over the years, I've grown and more recently evolved from being just a follower to more of a leader. The transition to a leader role has made me a good public speaker and no longer an introvert but rather right in between introverted and extroverted. My leadership style is mostly to lead by example however I'm also a vocal leader when I need to be providing encouragement and inspiration to the people around me. </p>
